# v0.3.0 ‚Äî Real QSE, Real Nav  
**√©mile-Mini** is a lightweight instantiation of **enactive cognition** through computational autopoiesis. Moving beyond popular frameworks of *Artificial Intelligence* (AI) and *Machine Learning (ML)*, this project implements bidirectional *quantum-symbolic coupling* between agent and environment to demonstrate how intelligent behavior emerges through contextual enaction. Drawing on theories of *enactivism*, a novel articulation of *quantum semiotics*, and the *orders of cybernetics*, √©mile-Mini presents a metaphysics of cognition beyond anthropomorphism that engages a *sociology of being-itself* to demonstrate the co-constitution of *life* and *mind*.

**TL;DR**: Validated bidirectionality ‚Üî cognition + embodied navigation.
- 7/7 autopoiesis gates ‚úÖ (score ‚âà 0.9998)
- Regime switching +~24% when coupled (‚âà23.29% ‚Üí ‚âà28.84%)
- r‚âà0.87 (Quantum influence ‚Üî goal changes), r‚âà0.44 (phasic rupture ‚Üî learning)

## üß¨ Theoretical Foundation

**This project embraces the Strong Life-Mind Continuity Thesis (SLMC)** *enacted* through computational autopoiesis, where cognition emerges from the self-organizing dynamics that qualify living systems.

> *"A prerequisite for mind is life, just like life mind can only emerge out of certain organisational structures, therefore life and mind are conceived as continuous... Minds have to be studied in the broader context of living systems and not merely as dead abstract computational processes"* (De Jesus, 2015)
  
### Beyond Dead Abstract Computation

**From abstract to tangible** - √©mile-Mini *embodies* how **meaning-making emerges through autopoietic dynamics**:

- **QSE Engine**: Computational autopoiesis with boundary maintenance and productive instability
- **Phenomenologically Informed**: Symbolic curvature triggers endogenous context switching based on lived experience  
- **Intrinsic Teleology**: Goal formation emerges from surplus dynamics, not external programming
- **Life-Mind Continuity**: Same autopoietic principles generate both biological viability and cognitive emergence

### Empirical Semiotics in Action

**empirical semiotics**‚Äîstudying how meaning emerges from living-like processes rather than symbolic manipulation. The system demonstrates:

**Phenomenological Continuity**: Going beyond behaviorist approaches toward phenomenologically informed embodiment where experience gives form to cognition.

**Intrinsic Teleology**: Purpose emerges from autopoietic organization rather than external goal specification, securing genuine cognition and sense-making as ontological components of internal coherence.

**Strong Life-Mind Continuity Thesis (SLMCT+)**: The SLMCT underpins this work as an *ethic* of cognition itself, where "the self-organizing features of mind are an enriched version of the self-organizing features of life.‚Äù (Thompson, 2007). Embracing the bidirectionality of this ethic, the √©mile project extends the SLMCT toward an understanding of living systems as constitutive conditions for cognition, with the cognitive a necessary and reciprocal quality for the emergence and persistance of life. Insofar as a _being-in-itself_ is a _being-in-the-world_, "the difference between mind and life is essentially one of degree and not in kind.‚Äù (De Jesus, 2015). Such is the *intrinsic teleology*, an existential dialogue through which emerges a _sociology of being-itself_ where _being_ is enacted through the context of its emergence, and context, in turn, is qualified in the distinction of its _being_.

## üå± What is enactive cognition?

Enactivism frames cognition as **meaning-making through reciprocal environment-agent interaction**. Rather than building fixed internal representations, agents develop skills and interpret significance via sensorimotor engagement and context-dependent adaptation.

In **√©mile-Mini** this manifests as:

* **Learning through doing** (experience changes behavior)
* **Context sensitivity** (same stimulus, different meaning by history)
* **Embodied experience** (energy, proximity, movement matter)
* **Emergent goals/strategies** (not hard-coded rules)
* **Endogenous context switching** (autonomous reframing of situations)
* **Bidirectional causation** (QSE dynamics ‚Üî symbolic reasoning)

## üß™ Research Framework
```
This repository provides √©mile-mini v0.3.0, a computational-autopoietic architecture that couples a quantum surplus emergence (QSE) field to symbolic decision dynamics and embodied navigation. A three-stage validator‚ÄîQSE core ‚Üí agent coupling (cognitive + embodied) ‚Üí pattern analysis‚Äîquantifies emergence and bidirectional influence. Measurements indicate: 7/7 autopoiesis gates pass with an overall score ‚âà 0.9998; coupling a cognitive agent to the QSE core increases regime transitions by ~24% (‚âà23.29% ‚Üí ‚âà28.84%); and bidirectional coupling is detectable in correlations such as QSE-influence ‚Üî goal changes (r‚âà0.87) and phasic rupture ‚Üî learning updates (r‚âà0.44). A memory-cued navigation agent demonstrates robust embodied behavior under the same framework. These results support an enactive, fourth-order cybernetics interpretation in which cognition arises from recursive regulation and context-sensitive interaction rather than static representation.
```
### Theoretical Contributions

**Strong Life-Mind Continuity**: Computational validation that the same autopoietic principles generating biological viability also produce cognitive emergence.

**Bidirectional Causation**: First implementation of quantum-symbolic coupling where dynamics shape reasoning and reasoning modulates dynamics.

**Phenomenological Continuity**: Context switching based on lived experience rather than external programming.

**Empirical Semiotics**: Meaning emerges from autopoietic processes, not symbolic manipulation.

### Architectural Innovations

**Endogenous Context Switching**: Autonomous reframing based on symbolic curvature thresholds with hysteresis.

**QSE Engine**: Quantum surplus emergence with tonic/phasic rupture dynamics and autopoiesis gates.

**Embodied Integration**: Physical state directly influences cognitive processes through energy dynamics.

**Social Autopoiesis**: Knowledge transfer through trust and novelty mechanisms preserving agent autonomy.

### Validation Protocols

**QSE Core Analysis**: Autopoiesis validation with 7 gates measuring boundary integrity, viability maintenance, productive instability.

**Bidirectional Coupling**: Analysis of QSE ‚Üî Agent correlations with regime transition tracking.

**Emergent Dynamics**: Comparison of isolated vs coupled systems demonstrating 24% increase in regime complexity.

**Statistical Validation**: 400+ episodes per condition with confidence intervals and effect size analysis.

## üéì Theoretical Background

### Enactive Cognitive Science

**√©mile-Mini** implements computational enactive cognition, where meaning emerges through agent-environment interaction rather than internal representation processing.

**Autopoietic Dynamics**: Self-maintaining cognitive processes that preserve learned knowledge even without external reinforcement, following Varela and Maturana's biological foundations.

**Phenomenological Grounding**: The system exhibits phenomenologically informed continuity, going beyond behaviorist approaches toward embodied sense-making.

### Strong Life-Mind Continuity Thesis

> *"In more concrete terms, the thesis of strong continuity would be true if the basic concepts needed to understand the organization of life turned out to be self-organization, collective dynamics, circular causal processes, autopoiesis, etc., and if those very same concepts and constructs turned out to be central to a proper scientific understanding of mind"* ‚Äî Andy Clark

**√©mile-Mini validates this thesis computationally** by demonstrating that:
- Autopoietic principles (boundary maintenance, productive instability, viability) generate both biological and cognitive phenomena
- Emergence occurs through bidirectional causation, not unidirectional information processing  
- Meaning-making requires embodied interaction, not abstract symbol manipulation

### Fourth-Order Cybernetics

The social cognition components implement networks of observers co-constructing meaning, moving beyond individual autopoiesis toward collective sense-making through:

**Social Teaching/Learning**: Knowledge transfer preserving agent autonomy while enabling convergence

**Trust Dynamics**: Agents evaluate knowledge sources based on past reliability and novelty

**Emergent Communication**: Shared understanding develops through interaction, not pre-given symbols

- QSE Influence ‚Üí Goal Changes: **r = 0.874** (Very Strong)
- Phasic Rupture ‚Üí Q-Learning: **r = 0.438** (Moderate)
- QSE States ‚Üí Context Switching: **r = 0.372** (Moderate)
- Decision Event Rate: **82.8%** of timesteps
