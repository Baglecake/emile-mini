**émile-Mini** is a lightweight, packaged demo of **enactive cognition** for research and teaching. It shows how intelligent behavior can emerge from an agent’s ongoing interaction with its environment—no static world model required.

* **Package name:** `emile-mini` (TestPyPI)
* **Import path:** `emile_mini`
* **CLI command:** `emile-mini`
* **Current CLI demos:** **social**, **maze**, **extinction** (cooperation/teaching; context‑switching; extinction/recovery)

---

## 🌱 What is enactive cognition?

Enactivism frames cognition as **meaning‑making through reciprocal environment-agent interaction**. Rather than building fixed internal representations, agents develop skills and interpret significance via sensorimotor engagement and qualia differentiation informed through context.

In **émile-Mini** this looks like:

* **Learning through doing** (experience changes behavior)
* **Context sensitivity** (same stimulus, different meaning by history)
* **Embodied experience** (energy, proximity, movement matter)
* **Emergent goals/strategies** (not hard‑coded “if X then Y” rules)

---

## ✨ Key features (v0.1.3)

* **Social learning demo (CLI)**: multi‑agent grid world with teaching, helping, cooperative monitoring
* **Knowledge transfer**: trust/novelty checks with high retention of shared values
* **Loop‑breaking pressure**: agents detect repetitive dynamics and force exploration
* **“Stuck” detection & help‑seeking**: agents ask nearby peers for help
* **Episodic surplus logging**: per‑step memory summaries for analysis
* **Proximity & energy models**: shared social detect radius and simple energy costs
* **Visualization**: auto‑saves `enhanced_social_qse_analysis.png` (trajectories, proximities, strategies, signals/relationships)

## 🆕 What else is new in v0.1.3?
* **Experimental Module Exposure Through the CLI**: Experimental modules place émile-Mini in competition with standard RL models to show how émile-Mini's enactive learning approach boosts performance beyond traditional reinforcement systems. The visuals below show the results of a maze challenge, where learners need to navigate a 2-d space to reach an objective, while avoiding traps disguised as ideal conditions. Results show how émile-Mini excels at challenges requiring adaptive decision making, changing context to avoid being caught in stasis or deceived by local optima. Context switching allows for émile-Mini to adapt policy to situation endogenously, offering a far more flexible set of actions than traditional RL models.

* -> Key Innovation: Intrinsic QSE dynamics preserve knowledge without external rewards
* -> Complementary to: Context-switching for escaping local optima
  
```
==================================================
EXTINCTION RESILIENCE ANALYSIS
==================================================
KNOWLEDGE PRESERVATION DURING EXTINCTION:
  QSE-Émile:   0.49% of pre-extinction knowledge preserved
  Standard RL: 0.00% of pre-extinction knowledge preserved
  → Advantage: 0.49% → (100% or infinite when Standard RL does not recover)

RECOVERY AFTER EXTINCTION:
  QSE-Émile:   114.80% recovery vs pre-extinction
  Standard RL: 0.00% recovery vs pre-extinction
  → Advantage: 114.80%

FINAL Q-VALUES:
  QSE-Émile:   0.0611
  Standard RL: 0.0219
```

-> **v0.1.3 Housekeeping**:
* Refactored imports and broke circulars for packaged demos.
* Added `-V/--version` flag and updated docs/examples table.
* Packaging metadata tidy‑ups for TestPyPI.

---

## 📦 Installation

### From TestPyPI (current release)

```bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple emile-mini==0.1.3
```

> **Names to remember**
>
> * Install: `emile-mini`
> * Import: `import emile_mini`
> * CLI: `emile-mini ...`

### From source (dev)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Baglecake/emile-mini.git
cd emile-mini
pip install -e .
```

---

## 🚀 Quick start

### CLI (recommended)

```bash
# v0.1.3: social demo (default: 3 agents, 120 steps, cluster radius 4)
emile-mini social

# customize
emile-mini social --steps 300 --agents 5 --cluster-radius 6

# additional CLI demos
emile-mini maze --steps 200 --size 12
emile-mini extinction --episodes 1 --phase-steps 120

# check version
emile-mini --version
```

The run logs social events and saves a figure as `enhanced_social_qse_analysis.png`.

### Programmatic (Python)

```python
from emile_mini.social_qse_agent_v2 import run_social_experiment
import numpy as np # Import numpy for potential calculations

# Run the social experiment simulation
env, agents, analysis = run_social_experiment(
    n_agents=5,
    steps=500,
    cluster_spawn=True,
    cluster_radius=4,
)
```
-> Then, examine the data collected by the simulation for further insight:

**--- Demo Insights ---** (example)
  
* -> **Final Agent Positions**
```
print("\n--- Simulation Insights ---")

# Display the final positions of the agents
print("\nFinal Agent Positions:")
for agent in agents:
    # Access the last position from the position_history
    if agent.position_history:
        final_position = agent.position_history[-1]
        print(f"{agent.agent_id}: {final_position}")
    else:
        print(f"{agent.agent_id}: No position history recorded")
```
  
* -> **Knowledge Gained and Embodied Cognition Mapping (social strategy)**
```
# Print insights into knowledge gained and behaviors (social strategy)
print("\nAgent Knowledge and Social Strategy:")
for agent in agents:
    print(f"\n{agent.agent_id}:")
    print(f"  Final Social Strategy: {agent.current_social_strategy}")

    # Show embodied mappings (knowledge gained)
    if agent.embodied_mappings:
        print(f"  Embodied Knowledge:")
        for category, values in agent.embodied_mappings.items():
            # Calculate and display a summary of learned knowledge for each category
            if values:
                 # Corrected: values is already a list, no need for .values()
                 avg_value = np.mean(values)
                 print(f"    {category}: learned about {len(values)} items, avg value={avg_value:.2f}")
            else:
                 print(f"    {category}: learned about 0 items")
    else:
        print("  Embodied Knowledge: None gained")
```

**--- Simulation Insights ---** (example)
```
Final Agent Positions:
Agent_0: (1, 1)
Agent_1: (3, 1)
Agent_2: (1, 1)
Agent_3: (1, 1)
Agent_4: (1, 1)

Agent Knowledge and Social Strategy:

Agent_0:
  Final Social Strategy: independent
  Embodied Knowledge:
    crimson_fruit: learned about 6 items, avg value=-0.90
    blue_fruit: learned about 1 items, avg value=0.35

Agent_1:
  Final Social Strategy: independent
  Embodied Knowledge:
    crimson_fruit: learned about 2 items, avg value=-0.90
    blue_fruit: learned about 2 items, avg value=0.35

... etc. (values for fruits will be identical, but the number of items learned will vary)

```
# You could add other insights here, for example:
# - Summary of actions taken (from action_history)
# - Analysis of social interactions (from social_knowledge_transfer or social_memory)

## 🎓 Method & research framing

* **MRP context.** *émile‑Mini* is part of a Major Research Paper exploring how **enactive cognition** can be implemented and studied in artificial systems.
* **Computational autoethnography.** The project treats system‑building, debugging, and run logs as first‑person empirical material. The researcher is a participant in the process; design moves, failures, and reframings are data that connect architecture → behavior → interpretation.
* **Empirical semiotics (meaning‑as‑change).** We measure meaning by **observable reconfiguration** in the agent–environment system (e.g., proximity dynamics, memory traces, strategy shifts) produced by architectural impositions and interactions.
* **Relation to Émile‑cogito.** *émile‑Mini* packages a concrete slice of a broader platform (Émile‑cogito”) exploring multi‑module orchestration (QSE core; symbolic, context, goal, and memory stacks; orchestration patterns). Here, *émile‑Mini* focuses on a reproducible **social learning** scenario for demos and analysis.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

* ✅ Expose maze + extinction demos via CLI (v0.1.3)
* Real PyPI release (CI trusted publishing)
* Verbosity flags & deterministic seeding
* More demos exposed via CLI (comparisons, fruit categorization)
* Dockerfile + GitHub Actions (build/test/publish)
