## Repository Abstract  

### Empirical Semiotics in Action
This repository presents émile-mini v0.5.1, an ***enactive-autopoietic*** computational architecture that couples ***quantum semiotics*** with attention and decision making. émile-Mini grounds meaning in four modalities of ***enactive cognition***: ***quantum*** (coherent autopoiesis), ***embodied*** (autonomous physicality), ***temporal*** (magnitudes of change), and ***social*** (observer affectation). These four modalities are bidirectionally coupled with context, bounding emergence within a feedback loop between agent and environment, and enacted through a recursive, fourth-order cybernetic pipeline:
   
   ```QSE core (autpoiesis gates) → agent coupling (enacted coherence) → pattern analysis (magnitudes of change) → existential pressure (observer enacted feedback) → recursion (↺)```

Measurements indicate: 7/7 autopoiesis gates pass with an overall score ≈ 0.9998; coupling a cognitive agent to the QSE core increases regime transitions by ~24% (≈23.29% → ≈28.84%); and bidirectional coupling is detectable in correlations such as QSE-influence ↔ goal changes (r≈0.87) and phasic rupture ↔ learning updates (r≈0.44). A memory-cued navigation agent demonstrates robust embodied behavior under the same framework. These results support an enactive, fourth-order cybernetics interpretation in which cognition arises from recursive regulation and context-sensitive interaction rather than static representation.
  
**empirical semiotics**—studying how meaning emerges from living-like processes rather than symbolic manipulation. The system demonstrates:

* **Phenomenological Continuity**: Beyond behaviorism, émile-Mini is a phenomenologically informed embodiment of cognition where "lived" experience gives it form.

* **Intrinsic Teleology**: Purpose emerges from autopoietic organization rather than external goal specification, securing genuine cognition and sense-making as ontological components of internal coherence.

   > This repository presents émile-mini v0.5.0, a computational-autopoietic architecture that couples a quantum surplus emergence (QSE) field to symbolic decision dynamics and embodied navigation. This release introduces enhanced navigation systems with a ***Proactive Embodied Agent***, comprehensive ***cognitive battery*** protocols, and optional ***multimodal integration***. The three-stage validator—QSE core → agent coupling (cognitive + embodied) → pattern analysis—continues to quantify emergence and bidirectional influence with improved robustness. New features include context hysteresis, memory module enhancements, and extensive CLI tooling for navigation reporting and PPO comparisons. These advances support sophisticated enactive learning scenarios while maintaining the core fourth-order cybernetics framework.

## 🧬 Theoretical Foundation

> *"A prerequisite for mind is life, just like life, mind can only emerge out of certain organisational structures, therefore life and mind are conceived as continuous... Minds have to be studied in the broader context of living systems and not merely as dead abstract computational processes"* (De Jesus, 2015)

**Strong Life-Mind Continuity Thesis (SLMCT+)**:   
The SLMCT underpins this work as an *ethic* of cognition itself, where "the self-organizing features of mind are an enriched version of the self-organizing features of life.” (Thompson, 2007). Embracing the bidirectionality of this ethic, the émile project extends the SLMCT toward an understanding of living systems as constitutive conditions for cognition, with the cognitive a necessary and reciprocal quality for the emergence and persistance of life. Insofar as a _being-in-itself_ is a _being-in-the-world_, "the difference between mind and life is essentially one of degree and not in kind.” (De Jesus, 2015). Such is an **intrinsic teleology**, an existential dialogue through which emerges a _sociology of being-itself_ where _being_ is enacted through the context of its emergence, and context, in turn, is qualified in the distinction of its _being_.

## Enactive Systems Design: An Architectural Methodology 
  
émile-Mini embodies *first-principles* intelligent systems design, emphasizing contextual autopoietic enactivism as the necessary precondition for both agent and environment. Formally articulated as ***"Enactive-Machine Interactive-Learner"*** the émile-series of cognitive models presents a novel synthetic extension of ***autopoietic enactivism***, ***existential phenomenology***, ***quantum semiotics***, and ***cybernetic theory*** as a viable metaphysics of ***sympoietic cognition***. Distinct from data-driven contemporary AI and a neutral party to anthropomorphism, émile-Mini engages a ***sociology of being-itself*** to demonstrate the co-constitution of ***life*** and ***mind*** as an existential quality of emergent cognition. This synthesis is operationalized through Python based simulation as an empirical condition of viability, currently formalized as **Quantum Surplus Emergence (QSE)** and embodied in four cognitive sympoietic components - **Agentic**, **Embodied**, **Social (Multi-Agent)**, and **Temporal**.

### Quantum-Semiotic Coupling: The Dynamics of Sympoietic Cognition
émile-Mini's quantum surplus emergence (QSE) engine instantiates bidirectional quantum↔symbolic causation as the computational substrate for enactive meaning-making: 
```   
   S ↔ σ ↔ ψ ↔ context ↔ action ↔ environment ↔ S  
```  
This autopoietic loop manifests across four phenomenological domains: 

1. **Agentic QSE:** Pure cognitive recontextualization through endogenous context switching  
```
    Input: Internal symbolic curvature σ = Ψ(S) - Φ(S)
    Output: Context switches when ⟨|σ|⟩ > threshold
    Dynamics: Self-organizing cognitive recontextualization
    Coupling: σ ↔ surplus ↔ quantum ↔ context
```
2. **Embodied QSE:** Sensorimotor integration where surplus fields couple perception and action  
```
    Input: Visual field + proprioception → sensorimotor vector
    Output: Action selection + body schema updates
    Dynamics: Spatial surplus evolution + collision learning
    Coupling: perception ↔ surplus ↔ quantum ↔ movement
```
3. **Social QSE:** Multi-agent sympoietic knowledge transfer through coupled quantum dynamics  
```
    Input: Social signals + proximity + teaching/learning
    Output: Knowledge transfer + strategy adaptation
    Dynamics: Coupled surplus fields between agents
    Coupling: communication ↔ surplus ↔ quantum ↔ social_strategy
```  
4. **Temporal QSE:** Anticipatory adaptation via emergent subjective time
```
   τ = f(Δσ) 
   Anticipatory: Context switches before explicit feedback  
   Temporal: Emergent time τ = f(Δσ) modulates subjective timing
   Preparatory: Surplus "primes" quantum state for incoming distinctions
   ❌ Not literal precognition (No violation of causality)
```
---
  
The QSE enables enactive autonomy as a ***phenomenologically coherent intrinsic teleology*** within bounds of autopoietic homeostasis (tonic). Where contemporary AI and ML organize around ***extrinsic*** ethics of optimization and externally oriented goals, émile-Mini is motivated by an ***"ontology of intrinsic teleology"*** necessitating ***mutually assured distinction*** between agent and environment as a ***bidirectional condition of viability*** for being-itself.
  
---
## **Bidirectionality of 4th-Order Cybernetics**   
where agent and context co-constitute conditions of viability in ***sympoiesis***.  
```
   S ↔ σ ↔ ψ ↔ context ↔ action ↔ environment ↔ S
```
### Four Orders of Autonomous Persistence
  
   **1) Phenomenological Coherence** - QSE dynamics generate intrinsic temporality through emergent time modulation, creating subjective experience of cognitive flow  
   
   **2) Quantum-Semiotic Autopoiesis** - The bidirectional S ↔ σ ↔ ψ coupling maintains operational closure while remaining informationally open to environmental distinctions  
   
   **3) Embodied Enaction** - Sensorimotor surplus evolution creates body schema and affordance detection through quantum-classical phase transitions  
   
   **4) Sympoietic Sociality** - Multi-agent QSE enables distributed cognition where social knowledge emerges through quantum field coupling between agents  
   

This 4th-order cybernetic architecture transcends subject/object dualism by implementing mutual specification of agent and environment through the quantum dynamics themselves. The system autonomously persists not through external reward optimization, but through the intrinsic teleology of maintaining quantum-symbolic coherence while navigating environmental complexity.
  
émile-Mini marks a milestone in the émile-series as the first production-ready cognitive design tested against modern and traditional reinforcement learning benchmarks, revealing intelligent behaviour and striking zero-shot aptitude. Presenting émile-Mini as a statement of both theory and praxis, this project proposes a new paradigm in ***Human-Computer Interaction*** (HCI) that seeks to unify ***higher-order cybernetics*** and ***artificial intelligence*** under an ***enactivist*** ethic of ***computational cognition***.

## 🌱 What is enactive cognition?

Enactivism frames cognition as **meaning-making through reciprocal environment-agent interaction**. Rather than building fixed internal representations, agents develop skills and interpret significance via sensorimotor engagement and context-dependent adaptation.

In **émile-Mini** this manifests as:

* **Learning through doing** (experience changes behavior)
* **Context sensitivity** (same stimulus, different meaning by history)
* **Embodied experience** (energy, proximity, movement matter)
* **Emergent goals/strategies** (not hard-coded rules)
* **Endogenous context switching** (autonomous reframing of situations)
* **Bidirectional causation** (QSE dynamics ↔ symbolic reasoning)

    dt=0.01,
    seed=42,
    output_file="coupling_analysis.jsonl",  # JSONL stream of per-step data
)

correlations = results["correlation_matrices"]["pearson"]
print(f"QSE → Goal Changes: {correlations['qse_influence_score']['goal_changed']:.3f}")
print(f"Phasic Rupture → Learning: {correlations['phasic_rupture_active']['q_value_change']:.3f}")

# Autopoiesis summary from the collector that actually ran
summary = runner.qse_collector.generate_summary_report()
